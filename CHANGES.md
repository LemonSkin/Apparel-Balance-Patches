# Progression: Apparel & Armour (Title TBC)
It always bother me when I install mods like Medieval Overhaul or one of the old-timey Vanilla Factions Expanded that all of the medieval clothing appears in the same research projects as more modern clothing. This mod aims to correct that.

On its own, this mod doesn’t do a whole lot - it creates a new research project to unlock the hand tailor bench. It is intended that this mod be used with other mods that add medieval apparel and armour to the game.

* Added new research: Rustic clothing (400)
    * Rustic clothing > Complex clothing
* Moved hand tailoring bench to Rustic clothing research
* Moved the following to Rustic clothing:
    * Robe
    * Hood
    * Cape (if Royalty or Biotech installed)
* Flak armor requires Machining and Complex clothing - Modern combat armour doesn't have much in common with medieval plate armour
* Plate armor requires Rustic clothing and Smithing
* Steel simple helmet now requires Complex clothing

# Integrations
## Royalty
* Modified research chains:
    * Rustic clothing > Noble apparel > Royal apparel
* Beret, Corset, Formal shirt, Formal vest, Ladies hat, and Top hat require Complex clothing + Noble apparel
* Royal apparel only requires Nobel apparel research
* Crown and Cornet also require Smithing

## Ideology
* Moved the following to Rustic clothing:
    * Flophat
    * Headwrap
    * Broadwrap
    * Slicecap
    * Tailcap
    * Visage mask
    * Burka
    * Slave Body Strap
* Added the following to Complex clothing:
    * Authority cap
* Shadecone and Slave collar added to Crafting spot for Tribal crafting

## Biotech

    * Kid romper
    * Sash

## Anomaly

## Medieval Overhaul
* Fixed random name capitalisations for recipes
* Rustic clothing renamed to Rustic tailoring, added to Medieval tab in place of Tailoring
* Renamed Tailoring to Complex tailoring and moved back to Main tab
* Moved most apparel items to Rustic tailoring research:
    * Arming cap
    * Braies
    * Coif
    * Full arming cap
    * Gambeson
    * Hood

    * Textile spinning > Rugs, Silk
    * Moved cloth and leather rugs to Rugs research
    * TODO: Will likely make leather and hide rugs neolithic tech for tribals to craft
    * Royal rugs moved to Royal architecture research and requires Rugs research
    * Silk rugs moved to Silk research and requires Rugs research
* Protective clothing now requires Rustic tailoring as a prerequisite
### Fixes
* Fixed assorted naming capitalisations and consistencies
### WIP: Stat Rebalances
Clothes and armour costs and stats are pretty out of whack with the vanilla game. I aim to make these more aligned to vanilla values to provide a proper sense of progression.

Generally, fewer clothes count for nudity - hats, helmets, gloves, boots, etc no longer count as clothing.

Clothing and armour has been balanced to align more closely with vanilla stats.

Armour and headgear has been balanced using Plate armor from vanilla and various medieval armors from the Vanilla Expanded mods.

Protective clothing provides additional warmth and is fast and cheap to make, but does not provide much in the way of protection. The kettle helm is more range-focussed, while the flat-top and nasal helms are melee focused.

Chain armour is lighter and more maneauverable than plate armour, but provides slightly less protection and takes a long time to craft. The chain coifs and kettle helm are range-focused, while the remaining helms are melee focused.

Plate armours have been rebalanced, but the various helmets are mostly equivalent and are there to provide flavour to your armies.

Gilded and Adorned counterparts provide equivalent stats but also include a social impact buff (dependent on armour tier) and take slightly longer to make. Adorned counterparts also have a slight buff to cold insulation.

Lindwurm armour is rare and quite difficult to make, however it is very protective, insulating and light.
